# Overview
This Github repository is for the crowd-sourcing of translations for multi-language support in [indieVelo](https://indievelo.com).

Contributions are warmly welcomed from the entire community - both for corrections and improvements to existing translations, and for the addition of new languages.

Please feel free to join the [indieVelo Discord](https://discord.gg/nY5u74u7Ak) to chat and share any thoughts, ideas or suggestions on translations (or anything else!). 

# Current Languages
Currently indieVelo supports the following languages (note that the 2-2 letter codes are [ISO standard country-locales](https://simplelocalize.io/data/locales/)):
* cs-CZ : Czech
* da-DK : Danish
* de-CH : Swiss German
* de-DE : German
* en-GB : English
* es-ES : Spanish
* fr-FR : French
* hu-HU : Hungarian
* it-IT : Italian
* ms-MY : Malay
* nl-NL : Dutch
* pl-PL : Polish
* pt-PT : Portugeuse
* ro-RO : Romanian
* sl-SL : Slovenian
* sv-SE : Swedish
* zh-TW : Chinese (Traditional)

Other languages it would be great to get help with translating are (in rough order of number of riders on indieVelo):
* Korean
* Norwegian
* Russian
* Japanese
* Finnish

Any other translations however would also be very gratefully received!

# Style Guide
A few miscellaneous notes based on experience from translating so far:
* In general, an informal tone should be used.  For example, in French the "tu" form is preferred over "vous", or in German "du" rather than "sie".
* Please follow the same capitalisation as in the original en-GB text.  Some text is deliberately entirely upper-case (mostly non-sentences: headings / button labels etc), and some deliberately lower case (mostly complete sentences that are used within menus), and the translations should do the same.
* The English phrase "Bring It On" doesn't necessarily translate literally!  This text is shown when you set a new Personal Best record, and should be translated into a suitably idiomatic victory shout / celebration.

# How-To
To make a contribution:

1. Create you own free personal account on GitHub.
   
2. Fork this repository.
   * This creates your own private copy of the files to edit.
   * Click the "Fork" button towards the top right hand corner of this page.

4. Edit any files as needed.
   * Select the files, then click on the pencil icon to edit.
   * If you are updating someone else's translation for anything other than obvious typos, please chat about it first on the indieVelo Discord.
   * Please note that the "en-GB" file is the primary translation and should not be edited (unless you spot a typo!).  Any translations into other languages should use this as the reference point for the meaning and intent for each phrase.  If adding a new language, take a copy of the contents of the "en-GB" file, rename it to the new language and then edit the new file directly.

5. Commit the update.
   * This only changes your own private copy of the files, not the main copies stored here.
   * Click on the "Commit Update" button that appears after you edit the file.
   * Note that you can make multiple edits and multiple commits before actually submitting any changes as below.
     
6. Create a pull request.
   * This submits all the changes to your private copy of the files for review into the main indieVelo code.
   * Click on the "Pull Request" button towards the top left hand corner of the page.
   * Then click on the "New Pull Request" button towards the top right hand corner of the page.
   * The click on the "Create Pull Request" button towards the top left hand corner of the page.
   * If this is your first edit, please do add your real name to the comments so that you can be credited properly within the indieVelo application.
   * Finally, click on the new "Create Pull Request" button towards the bottom of the area where you can add any comments.
     
8. Wait for it to be approved.
   * Once approved, changes will be made live to indieVelo almost instantly, without the need to wait for a new release.
